The Hotel Reservation System is a software application designed to streamline 
the process of booking hotel rooms, managing guest data, and handling 
payments. It serves as a centralized platform for both hotel staff and guests, 
ensuring efficient operations and enhanced customer satisfaction. The system 
automates manual tasks, reduces errors, and provides real-time information 
about room availability, reservations, and payments. 
This project aims to create a robust and user-friendly system that caters to the 
needs of modern hotels, enabling them to manage their operations effectively 
while providing a seamless experience for guests.
